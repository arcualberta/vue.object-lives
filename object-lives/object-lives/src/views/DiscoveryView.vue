        The Object Lives project explores the trajectories and changing meanings
        of objects moving across cultures and global spaces. How we do this has
        proven to be a development of the team’s collaborative approach and a
        distinct and exciting research methodology. The ‘discovery process’ we
        used at the Pitt Rivers Museum in 2015 is still developing, and we
        comment on it in this series of images and captions. We look forward to
        refining it at the McCord Museum workshop in 2016.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Before the team met at Oxford, we discussed and shared our goals for
        object-based study, got to know each others’ areas of expertise, and
        worked to decide what kinds of objects would be useful to examine
        together, where the overlaps and gaps in our knowledge would provide
        exciting discussions.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Once we were all in the room with the objects, we realized that not only
        were many people contributing to discussions, extending (and querying!)
        sets of knowledge, but that different perspectives enhanced the overall
        richness of discussion. We also engaged in ‘close looking’ with
        objects—like the classic literary method, ‘close reading’—making close
        physical examination the basis for observation, reflection, querying,
        bringing knowledge and perspectives together, and generating further
        research questions.

        We brought items out in related groups where possible, to spark
        comparisons across objects. This picture shows garments from the PRM
        collections, waiting in the research room for the Object Lives team to
        come and think and talk about them. The blue wool coat and leggings and
        hat are Wendat, c.1830; the flared hide coat with cloth trim is northern
        Ojibwa/Cree/Metis, c.1800-1830; and the quilled and painted hide coat on
        the right is northern Plains/Parkland, c. 1820.
      </p>
      <p>
        The coats are all very different in cut and decorative treatment, and
        helped us to think about the specifics of local histories which created
        them and the broad similarities of European/Aboriginal contact in which
        they all emerged as hybrids of European and Aboriginal design. The power
        of the coats is apparent, from their creation to use(s).

        Photography is one way of focusing on the details of objects, really
        ‘seeing’ them in order to think about them. Wendat scholar, Jonathan
        Lainey, specializes in Wendat items and especially in wampum, but helped
        the team by bringing his photographic skills to bear on all the objects
        we considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he is participating in a conversation about the fancy brocade trim
        on the hide coat. We wondered what kind of fabric to call it, and
        decided that we could Photoshop images of it together to make a larger
        image and thus help to identify it. The brocade trim, along with the
        plain twill wool lining of the coat, may have been added at a later
        date, possibly after the coat was taken to England by its collector, so
        identifying this fabric might help us to think about the coat’s history
        and the different people who may have contributed to its manufacture.

        things up online while we were all together in the research room with

        Long close looking requires attention to all parts of an object, not
        simply the beautiful patterns and details that were made for public
        display. Here, the underside of a Wendat saddlebag is examined for what

        understanding how an object would have been used.
      </p>
      <p>
        This attention ensures that we consider the life of the object and its
        role in the day to day activities of its user(s), not simply how it
        might resonate aesthetically. Thinking about these objects, we work to
        see the full range of material evidence and also see beyond the visual.
        We recognize the agency of objects throughout their ‘object lives’. We
        also look to identify the things we can’t always see, bringing together
        questions from the material evidence and our wider knowledge.

        they hang? How could they have been used? What tasks were they made for
